# Zettelkasten

I'm trying to utilize Zettelkasten for the first time. I don't know much just yet but I'm trying.
I'm watching youtube videos and using the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) as a guide.

## Limerence

Limerence is a state in which a person yearns for someone's attention. Like getting attached to them, only admiring them and not getting their attention makes them anxious.

## Office attendance service
Writing an attendance service that will mark my attendance automatically when I'm connected to the office wifi network.

1. Systemd service should execute a zig script after connecting to the office wifi.
2. After a wifi connection, check if the network is the office network.
3. Get the current time. If the time is between 1000IST and 1900IST, mark attendance.
4. Write the date to a file.

### Zig script
I'll start by writing a zig script. In zig I can only get the curent unix timestamp so I'll have to write my own function to convert it to IST.
