# Organizing life

## Priorities
1. Job at Google
2. Habits
3. Health & Sleep

## Plan
I could do DSA in both TS and Zig at the same time. This will help me improve at both zig and DSA.
In the meanwhile, I also need to comeup with project ideas to solve. I need a habit of completing certain things everyday.
This is the list of priorities:
1. DSA(zig + ts)
