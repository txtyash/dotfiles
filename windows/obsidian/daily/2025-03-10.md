## 🌙 Evening Reflection

It was fine. I did good work, I didn't smoke either so no time was wasted yesterday. I did watch some television after work. I also solved a DSA question: [[leetcode-53-maximum-subarray]]. I tried figuring out the entire logic by myself but failed so I feel that its better to just quickly go through the problems and focus more on the complexity instead of figuring out the code complexity.
