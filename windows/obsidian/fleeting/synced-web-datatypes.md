# synced-web-datatypes
## Thought/Idea
When we have a separate frontend say Svelte using TS, then the types from the backend will have to be replicated on the frontend as well. This file should be generated by the backend API everytime it is built. This way the frontend is always aware of the type of data any API endpoint sends.

## Possible Connections
<!-- Any initial thoughts on how this connects to existing notes or concepts? -->

## Context/Source
This idea originated from when Primagen mentioned that one disadvantage of using frontend frameworks is that you have to recreate data types on the frontend as well as the backend in this youtube video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhXyn0Vrwv4>
