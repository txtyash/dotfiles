# zettelkasten

## Thought/Idea
Zettelkasten is a note taking system in which instead of organizing notes into hierarchical directories, you create unorganized notes which are interlinked to each other. There are 3 types of notes in the Zettelkasten system

## Possible Connections
<!-- Any initial thoughts on how this connects to existing notes or concepts? -->

## Context/Source
I saw a video about the Zig-Zap backend framework written in [[zig|Zig]], in which they introduce the creator of Zig-Zap as also the creator of the Telekasten plugin for Neovim.

*Fleeting notes should be processed within 1-2 days. Either convert to a permanent note or discard.*
