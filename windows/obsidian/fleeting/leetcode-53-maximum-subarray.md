## Approach
The approach was to drop a number everything until it the sum was negative and gulp when 

### Brute force
_Discuss your brute force approach_
#### Time Complexity
There is a single loop that goes through the entire array and the number of iterations grow with `n`, so the complexity is `O(n)`. 

#### Space Complexity
We only create a few variables that store integers. The number of variables does not grow with `n`, and neither does the space occupied by them(`O(1)`), so the complexity remains the same .i.e, `O(1)`.

### Approach 2
_Discuss other optimal approach_
#### Time Complexity
_Understand the time complexity in depth_
#### Space Complexity
_Understand the space complexity in depth_
