From hiding under the bed
Running to the roof
sitting in the very corner of the classroom
putting on earphones and laying his headdown

the very instinct of of expression had withered away 
all thats left is a faint understanding of himself


and when showing up became necessary for survival
it became faking smiles
crying on the bathroom floor
abusing substance
drinking

he would show up to work everyday
turning up music, showering and a diet became a part of him
being nice to people isn't a burden now
quitting drinking, smoking 
he does laundry and bills 
he's started discovering himself again
adapting to this is difficult but gifting
and the blinders of societal validations and abstractions are slowly drawn away
he has started over
I hope to see him a few years later
