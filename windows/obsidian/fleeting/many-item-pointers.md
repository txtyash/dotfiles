# Many Item Pointers

## Thought/Idea
	
Many item pointers are a pointer to a collection. This collection could be of any type.
1. How do many item pointers differ from pointer to any array? Like how is `[*]T` different from `*[N]T?`
  - `*[N]T` is compile time known, whereas `[*]T` is not.
  - `[*]T` supports arithmetic, whereas `*[N]T` does not.
