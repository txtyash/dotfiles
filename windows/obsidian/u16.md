# u16

u16 is a datatype in languages like [[zig|Zig]] & Rust. I will focus only on Zig.

## Range
A very important concept is determining how many values can be represented using `n` bits.

**How many values can u16 represent?**
Let's say we have only **1 bit** then we can represent 2 values, **0 & 1**.
When we have **2 bits** then we can represent 4 values **00, 01, 10, & 11**. That's because we just doubled the permutations we could do when we had a single bit.
The below diagram helps us understand why the formula `k^n` even works
![[bits-and-values.excalidraw]]
with 2 bits we could represent 4 values, but by adding an extra bit we essentially double the previous values we had where each of the previously generated values can now be prepended by either a 0 or a 1. Do this for all the values and we have doubled the permutations we had.

Therefore, using the above technique we can represent `2^16`(65536) values with a `u16` datatype. Basically values from **0 up to 65535**. It is unsigned so it does not represent negative values.
