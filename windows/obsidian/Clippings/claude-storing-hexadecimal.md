> storing a one digit positive integer would require how many bits?

To store a one-digit positive integer (i.e., numbers from 1 to 9), you would need 4 bits.

Here's why:

With 3 bits, you can represent 2³ = 8 different values (typically 0-7). With 4 bits, you can represent 2⁴ = 16 different values (typically 0-15).

Since we need to represent 9 different values (1 through 9), 3 bits would not be sufficient, but 4 bits would be enough. While 4 bits could technically represent more values than needed, it's the minimum number of bits required to represent all one-digit positive integers.

If you were including 0 as well (0-9), you would still need 4 bits for the same reason.

> is that formula for permutation?

No, that's not the formula for permutation. What I was using is the basic formula for determining how many different values can be represented with a certain number of bits:

2^n = number of possible values

Where n is the number of bits. This is because each bit can be in one of two states (0 or 1), and with n bits, you have 2 choices for each of the n positions.

The formula for permutation is different. For permutations of n objects taken r at a time, the formula is:

P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!

Where n! represents n factorial (n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1).

For example, the number of ways to arrange 5 objects taken 3 at a time would be: P(5,3) = 5! / (5-3)! = 5! / 2! = 120 / 2 = 60

> logic behind this formula? > 2^n = number of possible values

The logic behind the formula 2^n = number of possible values comes from understanding how binary representation works:

Each bit in a binary number can be in one of two states: 0 or 1.

When you have multiple bits, you multiply the possibilities for each position:

- With 1 bit, you have 2 possibilities: 0 or 1
- With 2 bits, you have 2×2 = 4 possibilities: 00, 01, 10, 11
- With 3 bits, you have 2×2×2 = 8 possibilities: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111
- And so on...

This follows the multiplication principle from combinatorics - if you have n positions, and each position can be filled in 2 different ways, then the total number of possibilities is 2 multiplied by itself n times, which is 2^n.

It's the same logic as counting the number of possible outcomes when flipping n coins, or answering n true/false questions - each independent binary choice doubles the total number of possibilities.

> so we need 4 bits for storing 1 quantity of both hexadecimal or decimal values?

That's a great follow-up question. Let me clarify:

For decimal (base 10):

- To store a one-digit decimal number (0-9), you need 4 bits since 2³ = 8 (not enough) but 2⁴ = 16 (sufficient)

For hexadecimal (base 16):

- To store a one-digit hexadecimal number (0-F or 0-15), you also need exactly 4 bits since 2⁴ = 16

This is actually why hexadecimal is commonly used in computing - there's a perfect mapping between 4 bits and a single hexadecimal digit. Each hex digit (0-F) represents exactly 4 binary digits (bits).

So yes, you need 4 bits for storing a single digit of either number system, though hexadecimal makes more efficient use of those 4 bits by representing 16 possible values instead of just 10.
